== docToolchain v2.2.0 has Been Released!

=== About This Release

This is a fresh release of many nice features. 
The best probably is the `exportConfluence` Task which lets you export a whole confluence space to AsciiDoc!

To test the new release, the docToolchain wrapper `dtcw` will not be updated until the end of the week.

To discuss the new features, a new https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/discussions/1020[discussion thread] has been created.

IMPORTANT: please take a close look at the changelog, because there are some breaking changes

== Changes which need migration

* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/937[#937 Confluence publish nested pages by heading]
+
This replaces the settings `allInOnePage` and `createSubPages`.
Migrate as follows:
+
** `allInOnePage = true` is the same as `subpagesForSections = 0`
** `allInOnePage = false && createSubpages = false` is the same as `subpagesForSections = 1`
** `allInOnePage = false && createSubpages = true` is the same as `subpagesForSections = 2`

* https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/issues/940[#940 simplify configuration to use preamble heading from h1 instead of configuration]
+
Migrate by removing the setting `preambleTitle` and set the correct first level heading in the document.
* Make `dtcw` (and some other shell executables) https://www.shellcheck.net/[shellcheck] proof

IMPORTANT: the docker image has been moved to **doctoolchain**/doctoolchain:v2.2.0

NOTE: a big "THANK YOU" to all *Sponsors* and *Contributors* who helped to support docToolchain!

You like docToolchain? 
What about helping to make it even better? 
docToolchain is a community project, so be part of the community which drives the project. 
You don't have to code for doing so. 
It would even help to brush up the docs, write tutorials or groom the backlog 
(I guess many of the open issues are already fixed).
